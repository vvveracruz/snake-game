# snake-game

A simple snake-game that runs on the terminal. To run open the snake-game folder then type  `c++ -lncurses snake.cpp`, then `.\a.out`.

This snake game is loosely based on a series of tutorials by [NVitanovic on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/NVitanovic): [part 1](https://youtu.be/E_-lMZDi7Uw), [part 2](https://youtu.be/W1e5wO7XR2w) and [part 3](https://youtu.be/PSoLD9mVXTA). The tutorials use `conio.h` which isn't available on unix so a fair part of that code needed to be rewritten. This runs on macOS Catalina just fine.
